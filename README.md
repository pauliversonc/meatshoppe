## Features

Meatshoppe web application includes the following features:

1. **Product Listing:**
   - Display a comprehensive list of available products, showcasing essential information such as product name, image, price, and a brief description. This provides users with a quick overview of the range of meats available for purchase.

2. **Product Pages:**
   - When a user clicks on a specific product from the product listing, they are directed to a dedicated product page. This page provides detailed information about the selected item, including specifications, customer reviews, and the option to add the product to the shopping cart.

3. **Shopping Cart:**
   - The shopping cart is a virtual space where users can review and manage the items they have selected for purchase. It displays a summary of the selected products, quantities, and total cost. Users can adjust quantities, remove items, and proceed to checkout from the shopping cart.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - The website is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts and functions well across various devices and screen sizes. Whether users access the Meatshoppe website on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the interface remains user-friendly and visually appealing.

5. **Promotions and Discounts:**
   - Implement a system for promoting special offers, discounts, or promotions on specific products or during particular periods. This can enhance user engagement and encourage customers to take advantage of exclusive deals, boosting sales.

6. **Product Filtering:**
   - Allow users to filter products based on specific criteria such as meat type, cut, price range, or dietary preferences. Filtering options make it easier for users to find exactly what they are looking for and streamline the shopping experience.

7. **Product Search:**
   - Implement a search functionality that enables users to quickly locate specific products by entering keywords. A robust search feature enhances user convenience and ensures that customers can easily find their desired items within the product catalog.

8. **User Feedback/Contact Form:**
   - Include a feedback or contact form that allows users to provide comments, ask questions, or report issues. This feature promotes user engagement and provides a channel for customers to communicate with the Meatshoppe team, contributing to a positive user experience.
